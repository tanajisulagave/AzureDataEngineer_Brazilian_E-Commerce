**üîß Overview of the Architecture**
This is a classic modern data platform using Azure services and following the Medallion Architecture (Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold), integrated with reporting in Power BI.

**üóÇÔ∏è Project Components**

***1. Source Control (GitHub)*** \
Purpose: Stores raw data files and possibly orchestration scripts, configuration files, or source metadata.
Usage: Acts as the starting point from where data is ingested using ADF.
2. ADF (Azure Data Factory)
Role: Orchestrator & ETL Tool

Actions:

Connects to GitHub (source).

Ingests raw data into Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2 Bronze layer.

Supports both batch ingestion and incremental loads using metadata-driven pipelines.

Key Features:

Pipelines, Linked Services, Datasets, Data Flows.

Triggering schedules (e.g., daily/hourly).

3. Bronze Layer (ADLS Gen2)
Role: Raw Data Storage

Characteristics:

Stores raw, unprocessed data from source systems.

Schema-on-read, no transformations.

Common formats: CSV, JSON, Parquet.

Benefits:

Acts as a data lake archive.

Provides traceability and auditability of raw data.

4. Silver Layer (ADLS Gen2 + Azure Databricks)
Role: Cleaned and Transformed Data

Transformation Tool: Azure Databricks

Actions:

Cleans, filters, deduplicates, and joins datasets.

Converts raw formats to optimized ones like Delta Lake or Parquet.

Implements business logic.

Benefits:

Removes noise and inconsistencies.

Ready for enrichment and business consumption.

5. Gold Layer (Synapse Analytics)
Role: Curated Data for Analysis

Storage/Query Engine: Azure Synapse Serverless SQL Pool

Actions:

Consumes cleaned data from the Silver layer.

Performs aggregations, dimensional modeling (Star/Snowflake schema), and final business rules.

Exposes views or tables to Power BI or downstream consumers.

Benefits:

Highly optimized for analytics.

Low-latency querying with Serverless SQL Pool.

Easy integration with Power BI.

6. Reporting (Power BI)
Role: Business Intelligence Layer

Actions:

Connects to Synapse via DirectQuery or Import mode.

Provides dashboards, reports, KPIs for end-users.

Supports data slicing, drilldowns, and filters.

End Users: Business Analysts, Executives, Stakeholders.
